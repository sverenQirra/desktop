## Download and Install the Game
 
The first step is to download and install the game on your PC. You can buy the game from Steam or other online platforms, or use your original CD-ROM if you have one. If you use Steam, you will also get the American Conquest Fight Back expansion pack, which adds more campaigns and features to the game.
 
After installing the game, you may need to apply a patch to fix some bugs and improve performance. You can download the patch from this link[^1^], which is at the bottom of the site. The patch also includes an English translation of the game if you need it.
 
## Apply the Windows 10 Fix
 
The next step is to apply a fix that will make the game compatible with Windows 10. This fix will solve the black screen problem, the error code 16 problem, and other issues that may prevent the game from running properly.
 
To apply the fix, you need to download a file called dgVoodoo 2.53[^1^], which is a wrapper that emulates old graphics cards on modern systems. You can also use newer versions of dgVoodoo, but some players have reported that they don't work well with this game.
 
After downloading dgVoodoo 2.53, unzip the file and copy the dgVoodoo-app and the 3Dfx file to your Divided Nation root folder, which is usually located at C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\American Conquest - Fight Back\Divided Nation. Then, copy the three DLL files (D3D8.dll, D3DImm.dll, and DDraw.dll) from the MS folder inside dgVoodoo 2.53 to your Divided Nation root folder as well.
 
Finally, run the dgVoodoo-app as administrator and configure it according to your system specifications. You can also change some settings such as resolution, anti-aliasing, or filtering to improve graphics quality.

## Tips and Tricks for Playing American Conquest Divided Nation
 
American Conquest Divided Nation is a challenging and rewarding game that requires strategy, tactics, and resource management. Here are some tips and tricks that will help you master the game and win your battles.
 
- Learn the strengths and weaknesses of each nation. Each nation has its own unique units, buildings, technologies, and bonuses. For example, the Confederates have cheaper infantry and cavalry, but weaker artillery and navy. The Mexicans have strong cavalry and guerrillas, but low morale and population limit. The Native Americans have fast and stealthy units, but limited resources and technology. Experiment with different nations and find the one that suits your playstyle.
- Use the terrain to your advantage. The game features realistic terrain effects that can affect your units' movement, visibility, and combat effectiveness. For example, forests can provide cover and ambush opportunities, hills can give you a height advantage and a better line of sight, rivers can slow down your enemies and protect your flanks, and bridges can be used as chokepoints or traps. Use the terrain wisely and don't let your enemies use it against you.
- Manage your resources carefully. Resources are essential for building your economy, army, and defenses. You need wood, food, gold, iron, coal, horses, and ammunition to produce various units and buildings. You can gather resources from mines, farms, plantations, trading posts, or looting enemy buildings. You can also trade resources with your allies or the market. However, resources are limited and can run out over time. Therefore, you need to balance your spending and saving habits and plan ahead for future needs.
- Build a balanced army. Your army should consist of a mix of different unit types that can counter your enemies' units. For example, infantry can counter cavalry, cavalry can counter artillery, artillery can counter buildings and massed units, etc. You should also have some support units such as healers, engineers, spies, or drummers that can boost your army's performance. Don't rely on one type of unit or you will be vulnerable to enemy counters.
- Use formations and tactics. Formations are preset arrangements of your units that can give them bonuses or penalties depending on the situation. For example, the line formation can increase your units' firepower and range, but reduce their defense and mobility. The column formation can increase your units' speed and maneuverability, but reduce their firepower and visibility. The square formation can increase your units' defense against cavalry charges, but reduce their firepower and movement. You can switch between different formations depending on the situation using the F1-F12 keys or the icons on the bottom right corner of the screen.
- Tactics are special commands that you can give to your units to perform certain actions or behaviors. For example, you can order your units to charge, retreat, fire at will, hold fire, stand ground, follow me, etc. You can use tactics to coordinate your attacks or defenses with your allies or to surprise or confuse your enemies. You can issue tactics using the T key or the icons on the bottom right corner of the screen.

These are some of the basic tips and tricks for playing American Conquest Divided Nation. There are many more advanced strategies and techniques that you can learn by playing the game yourself or watching other players online. We hope you enjoy this classic game and have fun!
